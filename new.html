      <h2>About Noise Pollution</h2>
      <p>Noise pollution is a growing concern affecting both urban and rural areas. It encompasses various sources of unwanted sounds...</p>

      <h2>Causes of Noise Pollution</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>There are many sources of noise pollution, but here are some of the main ones:</li>
        <h3>Traffic noise</h3>
        <li>Traffic noise accounts for most polluting noise in cities. For example, a car horn produces 90 dB and a bus produces 100 dB.</li>
        <h3>Air Traffic</h3>
        <li>There are fewer aircraft flying over cities than there are cars on the roads, but the impact is greater: a single aircraft produces 130 dB.</li>
        <h3>Construction sites</h3>
        <li>Building and car park construction and road and pavement resurfacing works are very noisy. For example, a pneumatic drill produces 110 dB.</li>
        <h3> Catering and night life</h3>
        <li>Bars, restaurants and terraces that spill outside when the weather is good can produce more than 100 dB. This includes noise from pubs and clubs.</li>
        <h3> Animals</h3>
        <li>Noise made by animals can go unnoticed, but a howling or barking dog, for example, can produce around 60-80 dB.</li>

      <h2>Effects of Noise Pollution</h2>
      <li>As well as damaging our hearing by causing — tinnitus or deafness —, constant loud noise can damage human health in many ways, particularly in the very young and the very old. Here are some of the main ones:</li>
      <h3> Physical</h3>
      <li>Respiratory agitation, racing pulse, high blood pressure, headaches and, in case of extremely loud, constant noise, gastritis, colitis and even heart attacks.</li>
      <h3>  Psychological</h3>
      <li>Noise can cause attacks of stress, fatigue, depression, anxiety and hysteria in both humans and animals.</li>
      <h3> Sleep and behavioural disorders</h3>
      <li>Noise above 45 dB stops you from falling asleep or sleeping properly. Remember that according to the World Health Organization it should be no more than 30 dB. Loud noise can have latent effects on our behaviour, causing aggressive behaviour and irritability.</li>
      <h3>  Memory and concentration</h3>
      <li>Noise may affect people's ability to focus, which can lead to low performance over time. It is also bad for the memory, making it hard to study.Interestingly, our ears need more than 16 hours' rest to make up for two hours of exposure to 100 dB.</li>

      <h2>Solutions to reduce noise pollution</h2>
      <p>International bodies like the WHO agree that awareness of noise pollution is essential to beat this invisible enemy. For example: avoid very noisy leisure activities, opt for alternatives means of transport such as bicycles or electric vehicles over taking the car, do your housework at recommended times, insulate homes with noise-absorbing materials, etc. Educating the younger generation is also an essential aspect of environmental education.

        Governments can also take measures to ensure correct noise management and reduce noise pollution. For example: protecting certain areas — parts of the countryside, areas of natural interest, city parks, etc. — from noise, establishing regulations that include preventive and corrective measures — mandatory separation between residential zones and sources of noise like airports, fines for exceeding noise limits, etc. —, installing noise insulation in new buildings, creating pedestrian areas where traffic is only allowed to enter to offload goods at certain times, replacing traditional asphalt with more efficient options that can reduce traffic noise by up to 3 dB, among others.
        
        In recent years, the European Union has been promoting the use of new barriers that allow changes in sound waves, mainly for motorways and other forms of transport such as trains. Tests have been carried out in the Benelux and it seems that this is going to be extended to northern Europe. At the same time, work is being done on new, spongier and quieter asphalts, which are also better for the environment.</p>
